# DomainSpecific-ImageRecognition

### I'm a passionate contributor to the TUBITAK project that is focused on image recognition and Deep Learning. I took on a wide variety of tasks covering the project's life cycle as part of this engaged activity.

### My focus was primarily on the 100 class dataset, where I've compiled and annotated data with a view to establishing robust model training. To ensure data quality, I employed advanced image preprocessing techniques, including histogram equalization and glare reduction, which significantly enhanced the dataset's utility.

### My crucial role involved experimenting with several prominent deep learning models such as VGG16, VGG19, EfficientNet, GoogleNet, Resnet50, and Resnet100. In order to address their specific image recognition task, I have carried out detailed performance assessments, carefully engineered hyperparameters and specially designed architectures on the basis of their known skills.

###  I've spent most of my effort refining the YOLO model to detect and classify objects in a precise manner, aligning this with our project's particular needs. I played a critical role in the optimization of model accuracy and overall performance by performing iterative experiments and architecture adaptations.

### I have acquired profound knowledge which has become important to the project's success through my active participation in dataset curation, rigorous image preprocessing and extended model experimentation. A testament to my commitment to excellence, my comprehensive approach ensured that the last model did not just fulfil project objectives but went beyond them.
